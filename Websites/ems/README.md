# Employees Management System App 

## Features (General)

- Roles are given to users so users with higher roles can edit data of lower roles but not vice versa.

- Variable Permissions 

- User has to have "Display Salary" or "Modify Salary" Permissions to view other users' salaries

- List of users only accessed by users with higher roles than **üü¢ Employee**

- New users can register emails but cannot log in until they get accepted from waiting list 

- Users Can upload profile images

- Important Actions like (Deleting User, Accept Registration, Decline Registration) sends emails by default to user

- Any Other changes you can use Mailer Page to send emails

## Performance 

- Users' list are requested as chunks

- Users from list are cached at localStorage

- User's profile image must have limited size

- Logged in user data are cached at localStorage

- In roles table instead of adding all users with **üü¢ Employee** role, If users do not exist or exists but no role is given then by default their role is **üü¢ Employee**

- Used connection pool so number of connections created is limited and users are queued

- Used <Image> provided by next for better SEO & performance



## Security 

- Used rate limiter to prevent many requests (password discovery attack)

- Used hpp to prevent http pollution requests (duplicate request's parameters)

- Used "?" to pass paramets to SQL instruction instead of direct pass it using ${} to prevent SQL INJECTION Risks

- Used Transaction when deleting user from multiple tables to ensure it's either deleted from all tables or rolled back

- Client side & Server side checking 
    - For images type & size
    - For data modification (at client we delete unauthorized input fields & at server we check roles & perms)

## Extra

- Used OOP to visualize and have understanding of each user role capabilities

- Abstracted execution of queries to function for multiple use

## Api Docs

https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/30506181/2sAXxMespT



## Usage 


1. In **next.config.mjs**, make sure to comment out `"localhost:5500/api"` if you're containerizing the application.

2. If you're containerizing but want to use the database on your host machine, use the **.env.dev** file.

3. Environment-specific instructions:
   
   - **For .env.local**:
     - Do **not** run Docker Compose. Make any changes you want directly in the app.
     - The client will run on port **:3000**, the server on port **:5500**, and the database must be hosted on your local machine.
     - Commands:
       - In `Ems/ems/`: `npm run dev`
       - In `Ems/Server/`: `npm run start`

   - **For .env.dev**:
     - The client runs on port **:3000**, the server on port **:5500**, and the database should be on your host machine.
     - Command:
       - Run `docker-compose --env-file ./Server/.env.dev up -d --build`

   - **For .env.prod**:
     - The client and server both run on port **:3050** (`server` will be at **:3050/api**), and the database is hosted in the MySQL container.
     - Command:
       - Run `docker-compose --env-file ./Server/.env.prod up -d --build`
